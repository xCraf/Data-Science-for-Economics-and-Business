The focus of this project was to help a company (MTA), who is doing a rebrand, in better understanding what to improve in their marketing strategies. We also proposed a new website interface with a chatbot (which can be seen here: [Home | MTA (craflen15.wixsite.com)](https://craflen15.wixsite.com/my-site)).
